# NetworkTool


A tool for remote control of your personal computers.

In order to run you must run the client.py file on the controlled computers (to make sure that all commands are running,
you must do so with administrator privileges, in addition to making sure that there is no Hebrew in the paths)
The server.py on the controlling computer and function.py should be in the same folder.
